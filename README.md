# librenms-oxidized_docker
Simple Portainer/Docker setup for LibreNMS + Oxidized

## Purpose
This is a basic guide to setting up a LibreNMS instance with Oxidized all inside a single Portainer Stack. The same basic steps would work with Docker Compose if you make a few modifications.

## Prerequisite
1. Host OS with Docker installed. I used Ubuntu 24.02.
2. Portainer installed. You can find instructions [here](https://docs.portainer.io/start/install-ce/server/docker/linux)
